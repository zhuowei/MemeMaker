MemeMaker generates captioned images based on built-in meme templates.

Now you can generate memes on the go on your iPhone, iPad, or even your Apple Watch. Share the memes you generate to Twitter, or save them to your Camera Roll.

(Yes, you read that right: generate image macros. On a watch. Welcome to the future.)

The meme templates are taken from Imgur's Memegen service.
